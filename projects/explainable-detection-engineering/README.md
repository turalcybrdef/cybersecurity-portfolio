## Project Overview
This project designs and implements an explainable, rule-based detection engineering system aligned with the MITRE ATT&CK framework. The system collects host-based telemetry from Windows and Linux endpoints, normalizes events into a unified structure, and applies ATT&CK-mapped detection logic with clear supporting evidence.

The focus of this project is transparency, repeatability, and investigative clarity rather than opaque anomaly-based detection.

---

## Objectives
- Build a lightweight SIEM-style detection pipeline
- Collect and normalize Windows and Linux host telemetry
- Develop 6–7 ATT&CK-aligned detection rules
- Validate detections using controlled simulations
- Produce evidence-backed, explainable alerts

## Technologies & Frameworks
- Wazuh (SIEM / detection platform)
- MITRE ATT&CK
- Elastic Common Schema (reference)
- Windows Event Logs
- Linux auth & process logs
- Atomic Red Team (validation)
