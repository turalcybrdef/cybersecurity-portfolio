# Log Monitoring & Alerting Project

## Objective
Build a Python-based log monitoring solution that detects suspicious authentication activity and records events for investigation.

## Scenario
Simulated detection of brute-force and abnormal login behavior using system authentication logs.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Log parsing and normalization
- Detection logic design
- Event storage using SQLite
- Alerting logic
- Secure coding practices

## Tools Used
Python, SQLite, Linux/Windows logs

## Outcome
Successfully identified repeated failed authentication attempts and logged structured security events suitable for SOC review.

## Evidence
- Screenshots of script output
- Sample sanitized logs
- Detection logic explanation
