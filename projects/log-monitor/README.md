# Log Monitoring & Alerting Project

## Overview
This project simulates a real-world security monitoring task commonly performed by SOC and Cybersecurity Analysts.  
The goal is to detect suspicious authentication behavior, record security events, and support investigation workflows.

## Scenario
Organizations must monitor authentication logs to identify potential brute-force attacks, unauthorized access attempts, and abnormal login behavior.

This project demonstrates how such monitoring can be automated and documented.

## Objectives
- Parse authentication logs
- Detect repeated failed login attempts
- Record security events in a structured format
- Support investigation and alerting workflows

## Skills Demonstrated
- Log analysis and normalization
- Detection logic design
- Incident identification
- Secure coding practices
- Documentation and reporting

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- SQLite
- Linux / Windows authentication logs
- Git / GitHub

## Methodology (High-Level)
1. Ingest authentication log data
2. Identify repeated or suspicious login failures
3. Store detected events for investigation
4. Review and document findings

## Outcome
Successfully simulated detection of suspicious authentication behavior and documented results in a format suitable for SOC review.

## Evidence
- Script output screenshots (to be added)
- Sample sanitized logs (to be added)
- Detection logic explanation

## Legal Notice
All activity was performed in controlled lab environments using test data for educational purposes only.
